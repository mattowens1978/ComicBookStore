# Welcome to the ComicBookStore README!

Once you have the project files and are able to RUN the program, there are very few instructions for this simple program.
## INSTRUCTIONS
### **Search**
Pressing either 1, 2, or 3 and then ENTER will allow you to search using the described method. For example, press '1' to search by Title. If you know the full Title of the comic issue, or even part of it, type that in and press enter. You will see a list of either the exact comic issue you were looking for, or if you typed a partial, you will see every comic issue that contains what you typed. You can literally type the letter 'A' and enter, and you will see a huge list of every comic issue with that letter in the title.
### **Quit**
Very simply, type '4' and press enter to exit the program.
